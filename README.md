## Problem
Determine and plot the response of the single degree of freedom system using MATLAB when 50 N of force (step input) is applied to the mass m. The system is at rest initially and the displacement of the mass m is measured from equilibrium position. The parameters of the system are given as m = 5 kg, c = 10 N-s/m, and k = 250 N/m. The initial conditions are x(0) = 0, ùë•Ãá(0) = 0.

## What's has been done in the MATLAB code?
The following were calculated for the given problem:

* Magnification factor
* Frequency ratio
* Damping ratio
* Steady state amplitude
* Steady state phase

1. The magnification and steady state phase values for the calculated damping ratio were plotted for various frequency ratios and compared with other damping ratios.
2. The displacement and velocity response of the system were calculated and plotted.

## MATLAB OUTPUT
Damping ratio:

        z = 0.1414

Frequency ratio:

        r = 0.9798

Magnification factor:

        M = 3.5714

Steady state amplitude:

        X = 0.0560

Steady state phase:

        phi = 81.7868
